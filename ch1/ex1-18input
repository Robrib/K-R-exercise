I told them to shoot a hundred rounds (do-do)
Like he tryna movie the body (movie)          

It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'


I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'


I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers        
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'
