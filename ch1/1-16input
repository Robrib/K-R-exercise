Many years ago, I practically memorized this little book. This was the seminal definition of the C language. It is still (even the old edition) a great introduction to the language. It is well written and surprisingly accessible, given the rather cryptic nature of the C language. I still find myself grabbing this book (1978 edition) first if I have a question. The only caution is that the C language has added some capabilities since this was first written, so you may find that some aspects of the language are not covered here. It also does not really deal with the standard libraries. The later versions of the book may have expanded and updated the coverage.

This is a surprisingly easy to read book. It's an oldie, but it's worth reading to understand C from the creator's perspective. These days I mostly use C# and C++, but C is the base for a lot of the languages and systems in place today. It's also good to know for embedded work. Author doesn't try to be academic, overbearing or condescending, so it's a pretty good read. It's very slim, but seems to cover everything one would need to know about C (it's not a big language to begin with).
