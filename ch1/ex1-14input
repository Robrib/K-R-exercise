This is a surprisingly easy to read book. It's an oldie, but it's worth reading to understand C from the creator's perspective. These days I mostly use C# and C++, but C is the base for a lot of the languages and systems in place today. It's also good to know for embedded work. Author doesn't try to be academic, overbearing or condescending, so it's a pretty good read. It's very slim, but seems to cover everything one would need to know about C (it's not a big language to begin with).
